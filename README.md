# Monkey Finder

Monkey Finder is an app build in .NET MAUI. It demonstrates the use of:
1. Using XAML UI to build cross-platform native UI
2. Using MVVM pattern to bind data/commands from XAML Page to ViewModel
3. Calling Model objects functions (i-e service layer) in ViewModel to get data from internet or any other source
4. Dependency Injection
5. How to use Platform features like Location, Map and Internet Connectivity

# Motivation
Coming from native iOS development background with 10+ years experience, I wanted to try .NET MAUI. This is a first app to learn some core concepts.

# Quick Start
